# Zig structs (userdata) in Lua

This example demonstrates the bare minimum to make Zig structs "available" in Lua.

For more interactive examples written in C, you can see [Programming in Lua, chapter 28](https://www.lua.org/pil/28.html).

> [!NOTE]

> At some point, I would like to recreate these examples in Zig.
